This repository contains MITgcm configurations and post processing scripts and notebooks to reproduce the results presented in the paper *The impact of initial tracer profile on the exchange and on-shelf distribution of tracers induced by a submarine canyon* by Ramos-Musalem, K. and S.E. Allen: submitted to Journal of Geophysica Research: Oceans. It is divided into:

* **experiments** - Data files and modified MITgcm routines for each run.
* **postprocessing** - Notebooks and scripts used to calculate transports, upwelled tracer and water onto the shelf, extracting density and tracer profiles, etc.
* **figures** - Notebooks used to generate the figures presented in the paper.
* **input_files** - All binary files required to rerun the experiments (initial temperature, salinity, tracer concentrations and bathymetry files) 

Some notebooks and scripts require modules from [canyon_tools](https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/canyontools).

There are 2 experiments with 4 runs each. Experiment AST (runs 01, 03) uses a bathymetry of a straight shelf incised by a submarine canyon of similar dimensions to
Astoria Canyon in the Washington shelf. The BAR (runs 01, 03) experiment uses a similar bathymetry to AST but incised by a canyon of similar dimensions to Barkley Canyon
on the shelf off the west coast of Vancouver Island. For each run in AST and BAR there is a corresponding run without a canyon, only a straight shelf. Runs without
a canyon are AST02 and AST04, and BAR02 and BAR04. Runs AST01 and BAR01 (and AST02, BAR02) have a linear initial temperature and salinity profiles, while AST03 and BAR03
have initial temperature and salinity profiles taken form ARGO floats and the Pathways cruise, respectively.
